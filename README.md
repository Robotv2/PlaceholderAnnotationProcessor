# Placeholder Annotation Processor

PAP (Placeholder Annotation Processor) is a project with the main goal is to simplify the creation of placeholders for Minecraft Plugin Developer. 

This project is greatly inspired by other similar project such as Aikar's command framework [https://github.com/aikar/commands] or Lamp [https://github.com/Revxrsal/lamp].

This plugin is, for now, only working with PlaceholderAPI but is intended to work with other plugins in the future.
